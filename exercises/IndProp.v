(** * Case Study: Regular Expressions *)

(** Many of the examples above were simple and the [ev] property
    even a bit artificial. To give a better sense of the power of
    inductively defined propositions, we now show how to use them to
    model a classic concept in computer science: _regular expressions_. *)

(** Regular expressions are a natural language for describing sets of
    strings.  Their syntax is defined as follows: *)

Inductive reg_exp (T : Type) : Type :=
  | EmptySet
  | EmptyStr
  | Char (t : T)
  | App (r1 r2 : reg_exp T)
  | Union (r1 r2 : reg_exp T)
  | Star (r : reg_exp T).

Arguments EmptySet {T}.
Arguments EmptyStr {T}.
Arguments Char {T} _.
Arguments App {T} _ _.
Arguments Union {T} _ _.
Arguments Star {T} _.

(** Note that this definition is _polymorphic_: Regular
    expressions in [reg_exp T] describe strings with characters drawn
    from [T] -- which in this exercise we represent as _lists_ with
    elements from [T]. *)

(*(Technical aside: We depart slightly from standard practice in
    that we do not require the type [T] to be finite.  This results in
    a somewhat different theory of regular expressions, but the
    difference is not significant for present purposes.) *)

(** We connect regular expressions and strings by defining when a
    regular expression _matches_ some string.
    Informally this looks as follows:

      - The expression [EmptySet] does not match any string.

      - The expression [EmptyStr] matches the empty string [[]].

      - The expression [Char x] matches the one-character string [[x]].

      - If [re1] matches [s1], and [re2] matches [s2],
        then [App re1 re2] matches [s1 ++ s2].

      - If at least one of [re1] and [re2] matches [s],
        then [Union re1 re2] matches [s].

      - Finally, if we can write some string [s] as the concatenation
        of a sequence of strings [s = s_1 ++ ... ++ s_k], and the
        expression [re] matches each one of the strings [s_i],
        then [Star re] matches [s].

        In particular, the sequence of strings may be empty, so
        [Star re] always matches the empty string [[]] no matter what
        [re] is. *)

(** We can easily translate this intuition into a set of rules,
    where we write [s =~ re] for [s] matches regular expression [re]:

                        -------------- (MEmpty)
                        [] =~ EmptyStr

                        --------------- (MChar)
                        [x] =~ (Char x)
                        
                    s1 =~ re1     s2 =~ re2
                  --------------------------- (MApp)
                  (s1 ++ s2) =~ (App re1 re2)

                           s1 =~ re1
                     --------------------- (MUnionL)
                     s1 =~ (Union re1 re2)

                           s2 =~ re2
                     --------------------- (MUnionR)
                     s2 =~ (Union re1 re2)

                        --------------- (MStar0)
                        [] =~ (Star re)

                           s1 =~ re 
                        s2 =~ (Star re)
                    ----------------------- (MStarApp)
                    (s1 ++ s2) =~ (Star re)
*)

(** This directly corresponds to the following [Inductive] definition.
    We use the notation [s =~ re] in  place of [exp_match s re].
    (By "reserving" the notation before defining the [Inductive],
    we can use it in the definition.) *)

Reserved Notation "s =~ re" (at level 80).

Inductive exp_match {T} : list T -> reg_exp T -> Prop :=
  | MEmpty : [] =~ EmptyStr
  | MChar x : [x] =~ (Char x)
  | MApp s1 re1 s2 re2
             (H1 : s1 =~ re1)
             (H2 : s2 =~ re2)
           : (s1 ++ s2) =~ (App re1 re2)
  | MUnionL s1 re1 re2
                (H1 : s1 =~ re1)
              : s1 =~ (Union re1 re2)
  | MUnionR s2 re1 re2
                (H2 : s2 =~ re2)
              : s2 =~ (Union re1 re2)
  | MStar0 re : [] =~ (Star re)
  | MStarApp s1 s2 re
                 (H1 : s1 =~ re)
                 (H2 : s2 =~ (Star re))
               : (s1 ++ s2) =~ (Star re)

  where "s =~ re" := (exp_match s re).

(** Notice that these rules are not _quite_ the same as the
    intuition that we gave at the beginning of the section.
    First, we don't need to include a rule explicitly stating that no
    string matches [EmptySet]; we just don't happen to include any
    rule that would have the effect of some string matching
    [EmptySet].  (Indeed, the syntax of inductive definitions doesn't
    even _allow_ us to give such a "negative rule.")

    Second, the intuition we gave for [Union] and [Star] correspond
    to two constructors each: [MUnionL] / [MUnionR], and [MStar0] /
    [MStarApp].  The result is logically equivalent to the original
    intuition but more convenient to use in Coq, since the recursive
    occurrences of [exp_match] are given as direct arguments to the
    constructors, making it easier to perform induction on evidence.
    (The [exp_match_ex1] and [exp_match_ex2] exercises below ask you
    to prove that the constructors given in the inductive declaration
    and the ones that would arise from a more literal transcription of
    the intuition is indeed equivalent.)

    Let's illustrate these rules with a few examples. *)

Example reg_exp_ex1 : [1] =~ Char 1.
Proof.
  apply MChar.
Qed.

Example reg_exp_ex2 : [1; 2] =~ App (Char 1) (Char 2).
Proof.
  apply (MApp [1]).
  - apply MChar.
  - apply MChar.
Qed.

(** (Notice how the last example applies [MApp] to the string
    [[1]] directly.  Since the goal mentions [[1; 2]] instead of
    [[1] ++ [2]], Coq wouldn't be able to figure out how to split
    the string on its own.)

    Using [inversion], we can also show that certain strings do _not_
    match a regular expression: *)

Example reg_exp_ex3 : ~ ([1; 2] =~ Char 1).
Proof.
  intros H. inversion H.
Qed.

(** We can define helper functions for writing down regular
    expressions. The [reg_exp_of_list] function constructs a regular
    expression that matches exactly the string that it receives as an
    argument: *)

Fixpoint reg_exp_of_list {T} (l : list T) :=
  match l with
  | [] => EmptyStr
  | x :: l' => App (Char x) (reg_exp_of_list l')
  end.

Example reg_exp_ex4 : [1; 2; 3] =~ reg_exp_of_list [1; 2; 3].
Proof.
  simpl. apply (MApp [1]).
  { apply MChar. }
  apply (MApp [2]).
  { apply MChar. }
  apply (MApp [3]).
  { apply MChar. }
  apply MEmpty.
Qed.

(** We can also prove general facts about [exp_match].  For instance,
    the following lemma shows that every string [s] that matches [re]
    also matches [Star re]. *)

Lemma MStar1 :
  forall T s (re : reg_exp T) ,
    s =~ re ->
    s =~ Star re.
Proof.
  intros T s re H.
  rewrite <- (app_nil_r _ s).
  apply MStarApp.
  - apply H.
  - apply MStar0.
Qed.

(** (Note the use of [app_nil_r] to change the goal of the theorem to
    exactly the same shape expected by [MStarApp].) *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (exp_match_ex1)

    The following lemmas show that the intuition about matching given

(** The next lemma is stated in terms of the [fold] function from the
    [Poly] chapter: If [ss : list (list T)] represents a sequence of
    strings [s1, ..., sn], then [fold app ss []] is the result of
    concatenating them all together. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, optional (EmptyStr_not_needed) *)
(* It turns out that the [EmptyStr] constructor is actually not
   needed, since the regular expression matching the empty string can
   also be defined from [Star] and [EmptySet]: *)

(* State and prove that this [EmptyStr'] definition matches exactly

(* FILL IN HERE

    [] *)

(** Since the definition of [exp_match] has a recursive
    structure, we might expect that proofs involving regular
    expressions will often require induction on evidence. *)

(** For example, suppose we want to prove the following intuitive
    result: If a regular expression [re] matches some string [s], then
    all elements of [s] must occur as character literals somewhere in
    [re].

    To state this as a theorem, we first define a function [re_chars]
    that lists all characters that occur in a regular expression: *)

Fixpoint re_chars {T} (re : reg_exp T) : list T :=
  match re with
  | EmptySet => []
  | EmptyStr => []
  | Char x => [x]
  | App re1 re2 => re_chars re1 ++ re_chars re2
  | Union re1 re2 => re_chars re1 ++ re_chars re2
  | Star re => re_chars re
  end.

(** The main theorem: *)

Theorem in_re_match : forall T (s : list T) (re : reg_exp T) (x : T),
  s =~ re ->
  In x s ->
  In x (re_chars re).
Proof.
  intros T s re x Hmatch Hin.

(** Something interesting happens in the [MApp] case.  We obtain
    _two_ induction hypotheses: One that applies when [x] occurs in
    [s1] (which matches [re1]), and a second one that applies when [x]
    occurs in [s2] (which matches [re2]). *)

(** Here again we get two induction hypotheses, and they illustrate
    why we need induction on evidence for [exp_match], rather than
    induction on the regular expression [re]: The latter would only
    provide an induction hypothesis for strings that match [re], which
    would not allow us to reason about the case [In x s2]. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The [remember] Tactic *)

(** One potentially confusing feature of the [induction] tactic is
    that it will let you try to perform an induction over a term that
    isn't sufficiently general.  The effect of this is to lose
    information (much as [destruct] without an [eqn:] clause can do),
    and leave you unable to complete the proof.  Here's an example: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re : reg_exp T),
  s1 =~ Star re ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.
Proof.
  intros T s1 s2 re H1.

(** Now, just doing an [inversion] on [H1] won't get us very far in
    the recursive cases. (Try it!). So we need induction (on
    evidence!). Here is a naive first attempt.

    (We can begin by generalizing [s2], since it's pretty clear that we
    are going to have to walk over both [s1] and [s2] in parallel.) *)

  generalize dependent s2.
  induction H1
    as [|x'|s1 re1 s2' re2 Hmatch1 IH1 Hmatch2 IH2
        |s1 re1 re2 Hmatch IH|re1 s2' re2 Hmatch IH
        |re''|s1 s2' re'' Hmatch1 IH1 Hmatch2 IH2].

(** But now, although we get seven cases (as we would expect
    from the definition of [exp_match]), we have lost a very important
    bit of information from [H1]: the fact that [s1] matched something
    of the form [Star re].  This means that we have to give proofs for
    _all_ seven constructors of this definition, even though all but
    two of them ([MStar0] and [MStarApp]) are contradictory.  We can
    still get the proof to go through for a few constructors, such as
    [MEmpty]... *)

  - (* MEmpty *)
    simpl. intros s2 H. apply H.

(** ... but most cases get stuck.  For [MChar], for instance, we
    must show

      s2     =~ Char x' ->
      x'::s2 =~ Char x'

    which is clearly impossible. *)

  - (* MChar. *) intros s2 H. simpl. (* Stuck... *)
Abort.

(** The problem here is that [induction] over a Prop hypothesis
    only works properly with hypotheses that are "completely
    general," i.e., ones in which all the arguments are variables,
    as opposed to more complex expressions like [Star re].

    (In this respect, [induction] on evidence behaves more like
    [destruct]-without-[eqn:] than like [inversion].)

    A possible, but awkward, way to solve this problem is "manually
    generalizing" over the problematic expressions by adding
    explicit equality hypotheses to the lemma: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re re' : reg_exp T),
  re' = Star re ->
  s1 =~ re' ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.

(** We can now proceed by performing induction over evidence
    directly, because the argument to the first hypothesis is
    sufficiently general, which means that we can discharge most cases
    by inverting the [re' = Star re] equality in the context.

    This works, but it makes the statement of the lemma a bit ugly.
    Fortunately, there is a better way... *)
Abort.

(** The tactic [remember e as x eqn:Eq] causes Coq to (1) replace all
    occurrences of the expression [e] by the variable [x], and (2) add
    an equation [Eq : x = e] to the context.  Here's how we can use it
    to show the above result: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re : reg_exp T),
  s1 =~ Star re ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.

(** **** Exercise: 5 stars, advanced, optional (weak_pumping)

    One of the first really interesting theorems in the theory of
    regular expressions is the so-called _pumping lemma_, which
    states, informally, that any sufficiently long string [s] matching
    a regular expression [re] can be "pumped" by repeating some middle
    section of [s] an arbitrary number of times to produce a new
    string also matching [re].  (For the sake of simplicity in this
    exercise, we consider a slightly weaker theorem than is usually
    stated in courses on automata theory -- hence the name
    [weak_pumping].)

    To get started, we need to define "sufficiently long."  Since we
    are working in a constructive logic, we actually need to be able
    to calculate, for each regular expression [re], the minimum length
    for strings [s] to guarantee "pumpability." *)

    that [s2] can be repeated any number of times and the result, when
    combined with [s1] and [s3], will still match [re].  Since [s2] is

(** * Case Study: Improving Reflection *)

(** We've seen in the [Logic] chapter that we often need to
    relate boolean computations to statements in [Prop].  But
    performing this conversion as we did there can result in
    tedious proof scripts.  Consider the proof of the following
    theorem: *)

Theorem filter_not_empty_In : forall n l,
  filter (fun x => n =? x) l <> [] ->
  In n l.
Proof.
  intros n l. induction l as [|m l' IHl'].
  - (* l = [] *)
    simpl. intros H. apply H. reflexivity.
  - (* l = m :: l' *)
    simpl. destruct (n =? m) eqn:H.
    + (* n =? m = true *)
      intros _. rewrite eqb_eq in H. rewrite H.
      left. reflexivity.
    + (* n =? m = false *)
      intros H'. right. apply IHl'. apply H'.
Qed.

(** In the first branch after [destruct], we explicitly apply
    the [eqb_eq] lemma to the equation generated by
    destructing [n =? m], to convert the assumption [n =? m
    = true] into the assumption [n = m]; then we had to [rewrite]
    using this assumption to complete the case. *)

(** We can streamline this sort of reasoning by defining an inductive
    proposition that yields a better case-analysis principle for [n =?
    m].  Instead of generating the assumption [(n =? m) = true], which
    usually requires some massaging before we can use it, this
    principle gives us right away the assumption we really need: [n =
    m].

    Following the terminology introduced in [Logic], we call this
    the "reflection principle for equality on numbers," and we say
    that the boolean [n =? m] is _reflected in_ the proposition [n =
    m]. *)

Inductive reflect (P : Prop) : bool -> Prop :=
  | ReflectT (H :   P) : reflect P true
  | ReflectF (H : ~ P) : reflect P false.

(** The [reflect] property takes two arguments: a proposition
    [P] and a boolean [b].  It states that the property [P]
    _reflects_ (intuitively, is equivalent to) the boolean [b]: that
    is, [P] holds if and only if [b = true].

    To see this, notice that, by definition, the only way we can
    produce evidence for [reflect P true] is by showing [P] and then
    using the [ReflectT] constructor.  If we invert this statement,
    this means that we can extract evidence for [P] from a proof of
    [reflect P true].

    Similarly, the only way to show [reflect P false] is by tagging
    evidence for [~ P] with the [ReflectF] constructor. *)

(** To put this observation to work, we first prove that the
    statements [P <-> b = true] and [reflect P b] are indeed
    equivalent.  First, the left-to-right implication: *)

Theorem iff_reflect : forall P b, (P <-> b = true) -> reflect P b.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  intros P b H. destruct b eqn:Eb.
  - apply ReflectT. rewrite H. reflexivity.
  - apply ReflectF. rewrite H. intros H'. discriminate.
Qed.

(** Now you prove the right-to-left implication: *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, optional (reflect_iff) *)
Theorem reflect_iff : forall P b, reflect P b -> (P <-> b = true).
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** We can think of [reflect] as a kind of variant of the usual "if
    and only if" connective; the advantage of [reflect] is that, by
    destructing a hypothesis or lemma of the form [reflect P b], we
    can perform case analysis on [b] while _at the same time_
    generating appropriate hypothesis in the two branches ([P] in the
    first subgoal and [~ P] in the second). *)

(** Let's use [reflect] to produce a smoother proof of
    [filter_not_empty_In].

    We begin by recasting the [eqb_eq] lemma in terms of [reflect]: *)

Lemma eqbP : forall n m, reflect (n = m) (n =? m).
Proof.
  intros n m. apply iff_reflect. rewrite eqb_eq. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** The proof of [filter_not_empty_In] now goes as follows.  Notice
    how the calls to [destruct] and [rewrite] in the earlier proof of
    this theorem are combined here into a single call to
    [destruct]. *)

(** (To see this clearly, execute the two proofs of
    [filter_not_empty_In] with Coq and observe the differences in
    proof state at the beginning of the first case of the
    [destruct].) *)

Theorem filter_not_empty_In' : forall n l,

(** This small example shows reflection giving us a small gain in

    can often lead to noticeably shorter and clearer proof scripts.

    This use of [reflect] was popularized by _SSReflect_, a Coq
    library that has been used to formalize important results in
    mathematics, including the 4-color theorem and the Feit-Thompson
    theorem.  The name SSReflect stands for _small-scale reflection_,

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced, optional (filter_challenge)

    Let's prove that our definition of [filter] from the [Poly]
    chapter matches an abstract specification.  Here is the
    specification, written out informally in English:

    A list [l] is an "in-order merge" of [l1] and [l2] if it contains
    all the same elements as [l1] and [l2], in the same order as [l1]
    and [l2], but possibly interleaved.  For example,

    [1;4;6;2;3]

    is an in-order merge of

    [1;6;2]

    and

    [4;3].

    Now, suppose we have a set [X], a function [test: X->bool], and a
    list [l] of type [list X].  Suppose further that [l] is an
    in-order merge of two lists, [l1] and [l2], such that every item
    in [l1] satisfies [test] and no item in [l2] satisfies test.  Then
    [filter test l = l1].

    First define what it means for one list to be a merge of two
    others.  Do this with an inductive relation, not a [Fixpoint].  *)

(** Next, use [In] to define an inductive proposition [NoDup X

    apparently trivial fact about numbers requires non-trivial
    machinery to prove, but we now have enough... *)

    label -- i.e., list [l1] must contain repeats.

    This proof is much easier if you use the [excluded_middle]
    hypothesis to show that [In] is decidable, i.e., [forall x l, (In x

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Extended Exercise: A Verified Regular-Expression Matcher *)

(** We have now defined a match relation over regular expressions and
    polymorphic lists. We can use such a definition to manually prove that
    a given regex matches a given string, but it does not give us a
    program that we can run to determine a match automatically.

    It would be reasonable to hope that we can translate the definitions
    of the inductive rules for constructing evidence of the match relation
    into cases of a recursive function that reflects the relation by recursing
    on a given regex. However, it does not seem straightforward to define
    such a function in which the given regex is a recursion variable
    recognized by Coq. As a result, Coq will not accept that the function
    always terminates.

    Heavily-optimized regex matchers match a regex by translating a given
    regex into a state machine and determining if the state machine
    accepts a given string. However, regex matching can also be
    implemented using an algorithm that operates purely on strings and
    regexes without defining and maintaining additional datatypes, such as
    state machines. We'll implement such an algorithm, and verify that
    its value reflects the match relation. *)

(** We will implement a regex matcher that matches strings represented
    as lists of ASCII characters: *)
Require Import Coq.Strings.Ascii.

Definition string := list ascii.

(** The Coq standard library contains a distinct inductive definition
    of strings of ASCII characters. However, we will use the above
    definition of strings as lists as ASCII characters in order to apply
    the existing definition of the match relation.

    We could also define a regex matcher over polymorphic lists, not lists
    of ASCII characters specifically. The matching algorithm that we will
    implement needs to be able to test equality of elements in a given
    list, and thus needs to be given an equality-testing
    function. Generalizing the definitions, theorems, and proofs that we
    define for such a setting is a bit tedious, but workable. *)

(** The proof of correctness of the regex matcher will combine
    properties of the regex-matching function with properties of the
    [match] relation that do not depend on the matching function. We'll go
    ahead and prove the latter class of properties now. Most of them have
    straightforward proofs, which have been given to you, although there
    are a few key lemmas that are left for you to prove. *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, standard, optional (derive_corr)

    Prove that [derive] in fact always derives strings.

    Hint: one proof performs induction on [re], although you'll need
    to carefully choose the property that you prove by induction by
    generalizing the appropriate terms.

    Hint: if your definition of [derive] applies [match_eps] to a
    particular regex [re], then a natural proof will apply
    [match_eps_refl] to [re] and destruct the result to generate cases
    with assumptions that the [re] does or does not match the empty
    string.

    Hint: You can save quite a bit of work by using lemmas proved
    above. In particular, to prove many cases of the induction, you
    can rewrite a [Prop] over a complicated regex (e.g., [s =~ Union
    re0 re1]) to a Boolean combination of [Prop]'s over simple
    regex's (e.g., [s =~ re0 \/ s =~ re1]) using lemmas given above
    that are logical equivalences. You can then reason about these
    [Prop]'s naturally using [intro] and [destruct]. *)

(** We'll define the regex matcher using [derive]. However, the only
    property of [derive] that you'll need to use in all proofs of
    properties of the matcher is [derive_corr]. *)

(** A function [m] _matches regexes_ if, given string [s] and regex [re],
    it evaluates to a value that reflects whether [s] is matched by
    [re]. I.e., [m] holds the following property: *)

    Finally, prove that [regex_match] in fact matches regexes.

    Hint: if your definition of [regex_match] applies [match_eps] to
    regex [re], then a natural proof applies [match_eps_refl] to [re]
    and destructs the result to generate cases in which you may assume
    that [re] does or does not match the empty string.

    Hint: if your definition of [regex_match] applies [derive] to
    character [x] and regex [re], then a natural proof applies
    [derive_corr] to [x] and [re] to prove that [x :: s =~ re] given
    [s =~ derive x re], and vice versa. *)
